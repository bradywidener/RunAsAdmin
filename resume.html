            If you are reading this, you have found my digital resume!
            This resume was developed by me and is hosted using Microsoft Azure Services.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am a passionate and experienced IT worker. I'm very familiar with the education and technology support industry, with over seven years 
            experience providing technology support for school systems across east
            Tennessee. I am looking to expand my knowledge and challenging
            myself in new areas while I continue to learn each day.
            <br>
            <br>
            In my free time, I am an avid reader and a "dog dad" to a spoiled beagle mix. I also take great joy
            in personal technology projects, like this site. Whenever I learn something new that may be helpful for others,
            I like to write the details up in a blog post on <a href="https://www.edtechirl.com">EdTechIRL.com</a>.
